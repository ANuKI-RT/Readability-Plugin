    <metricDescription>Try to minimise the number of numbers per line in the code.
        Too many numbers in a line make the code rather confusing and reduce its readability.
        For large calculations, it is therefore advisable to divide the calculation
        into smaller calculations and then combine them later</metricDescription>
    <goodCodeDescription>In this code the calculation is made in different steps in multiple lines</goodCodeDescription>
    <goodCode>public static void performCalculations() {
    double firstFactor = (58 + 10 * 2.2);
    double secondFactor = (2 + 6 / 3.54 * 7);
    double thirdFactor = (25 * 2 / 2 * 8.4);

    int result = firstFactor * secondFactor * thirdFactor;
    System.out.println(&quot;Result of the calculations: &quot; + result);
}</goodCode>
    <badCodeDescription>In this code all the calculations are made in one single line</badCodeDescription>
    <badCode>public static void performCalculations() {
    int result = (58 + 10 * 2.2) * (2 + 6 / 3.54 * 7) * (25 * 2 / 2 * 8.4);
