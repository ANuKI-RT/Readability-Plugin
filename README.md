### Code Readability Plugin:

This folder contains the source code for the Code Readability Plugin.
The plugin is based on the readability model provided by the replication package of Simone Scalabrino et al.'s paper "A Comprehensive Model for Code Readability" (https://dibt.unimol.it/report/readability/). It shows color-coded ratings of the readability model in the source code.

The sources folder contains its own README.md.
