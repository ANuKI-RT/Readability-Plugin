    <metricName>DFT Commas</metricName>
    <metricDescription>The distribution of special code features relative to the code plays a role in the readability of code.
        This means that features should be periodically distributed evenly
        rather than only occurring at a certain point or wildly distributed in the code.
        In this case, the aim is to distribute the use of commas as evenly as possible in the code,
        as this is generally more readable than using many commas in some places,
        a few in some places and no commas at all in other places.</metricDescription>
    <goodCodeDescription>In this example the use of commas is evely distributed throughout the code.</goodCodeDescription>
    <goodCode>public void declarationExample() {
    int a, b;
    int c, d;
    int e, f;
    int g, h;
    int i, j;
    int k, l;
    int m, n;
}</goodCode>
    <badCodeDescription>In this example the use of commas is not evenly distributed</badCodeDescription>
    <badCode>public void declarationExample() {
    int a, b;

    int d,e,f,g,h;
