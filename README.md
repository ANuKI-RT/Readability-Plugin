### Code Readability Plugin:

This repository contains the source code for the Code Readability Plugin.
The plugin is based on the readability model provided by the replication package of Simone Scalabrino et al.'s paper "A Comprehensive Model for Code Readability" (https://dibt.unimol.it/report/readability/). 
The IntelliJ plugin shows color-coded readability ratings in the source code.

The sources folder contains its own README.md.
